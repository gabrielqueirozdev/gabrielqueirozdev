### Hi, I'm Gabriel Queiroz 👋

I work as a front-end developer at Softecnologia

Since I was 15 years old, I've been venturing into the world of programming, and today I certainly don't know what I would be if I weren't a developer. 😅

I love what I do and I'm always looking for new things to learn. 📖

### What i am focusing on? 👨🏽‍💻

My favorite skills are: ReactJS, Next.JS and Node.js.
